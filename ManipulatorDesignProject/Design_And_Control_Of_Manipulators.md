## Design and Control of Manipulators 

Design and control of manipulators (approximately 3000 words)

## *Introduction*

The Design and Control of Manipulators is one section the roco224 coursework, alongside ‘Programming Industrial Robots’ It consists of a student-driven group design project, where the goal is to fulfil a chosen task related to the field of robotic manipulators. Our group is named ‘Rossumovi Roboti’ and consists of four members:

Spencer Perdomo-Davies

Robert Grainger

Jack Gell

Faisal Fazal-Ur-Rehman

There are 8 project challenges to choose from, though the group could design a new challenge if desired. After some discussion, our group has settled on challenge 4 – The Redundant Freedom Arm. However, due to our large group size we have also decided to incorporate elements of 2 – Pick and Place. This will allow us to allocate a suitable quantity of work amongst ourselves.


### Description of hardware 

### Description of task

### An overview of your approach to the problem

## *Design Process*

Since the arm has 8 servos, the idea behind the design was to keep it as light as possible. We decided to directly attach each servo on to the previous one without any links between them except for one link that goes after the shoulder joint. After we had a rough idea of our design, the first thing we did was to make sure that the RX-28 servos (especially the servo that will need maximum ammout of torque) will be able to deliver the required torque for the design, for this we derived the moment formulas for our design.

stress. The second page account for when not at 90 degrees.

### What design iterations have you gone through?

### Who worked on what and when?

### What problems did you encounter, and how did you solve them?

## *Implementation*

### Describe the final implementation of your manipulator

### Include figures with images/drawings etc

### Include your solutions for kinematics, motion planning etc.

### Be brief, include support material in appendices, if need be

## *Experiments* 

### What testing have you performed of the robot (or subsystems)

### How well have you been able to perform the goal task?

### Include a Method, Results, and Discussion sub-section for each experiment

## *Conclusion*

### Briefly conclude this part of the coursework
