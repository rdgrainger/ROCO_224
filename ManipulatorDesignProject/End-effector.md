# End-effector

The end-effector for the redundant arm is going to be a pincer style gripper which
is to be operated by two servos. One servo will close the gripper whilst the other
will control the rotation of the end effector. The user will be able to control the end
effector from the serial terminal (putty) and information will be fed back on the angle
and the state of the gripper.

This End-effector is to be 3D printed from PLA for the following reasons.

* PLA is biodegradable opposed to ABS.

* PLA has a lower specific gravity to ABS meaning a smaller moment on the dynamixels.

* This end-effector does not need the added strength or higher melting point advantages that ABS offers.

* PLA is more aesthetically pleasing.

I cannot see any advantages of using ABS over PLA and we dont expect the End_effector
to under go much wear and tear.
